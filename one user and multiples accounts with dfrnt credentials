##### One user sts(Identity Account)is there with AssumeRole its will access all the Multiple aws accounts with different credentials ######
##### we have roles like kplabs-sts and fo this administratio and s3 ull access is there 
##### user belongs seperate account its has (access_key and secrey_key) its has assuem the rols and create resource in different account 
      (it will access therouhn arn of user)
##### role has separate account 

>> now we can type like --> aws s3 ls
   it will show error bcz it doenst have any permisssion except like AssumeRole

>now we want to create a resource in other account 1st we have to assume the role and from that role credetials go head and create resource
  example:- ( aws sts assume-role --role-(paste here role arn)--role-session-name kplabs-testing) 
            by using above command its get the credentials of that particular account 
            
Example:-
 
   provider.tf
   
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-1"
     assume_role {
       role_arn  = "role arn"    ---> if we are not giving this we will get error like unauthorised 
       session_name = "our wish" --->
      }
   }
   
   elp.tf 
   
   resource "aws_elp" "myelp" {
       vpc = "true"
   }    
   
   Now we can apply terraform apply and check it now
