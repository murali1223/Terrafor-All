## Terraform import:-

It might happend that there is a resource which is already created manually.
in such case, any change you want to make to that resource , must be done manually 

Def:- Import the specific structure into terrform structure


Example :-  


   provider.tf
   
   provider "aws" {
      region = "us-west-1"
   }
   
   ec2.tf
   
   resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {
     ami = "our manual instance id"           (means which one u want to import into terraform structure)
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
     vpc_security_group_ids = ["......."]      (means which one u want to import into terraform structure)
     key_name = "which key u have for that resource"
     subnet_id =  "subnetid"
     
     tags {
        name = "murali"
     }
  }   
  
  ## now youcan apply terraform plan apply we will get error , bcz its not linked to the resource file

## Now we have to import the state of the ec2 instance and link to the manual configuration of terraform resource 

-----> terraform  import aws_instance.myec2 (here we can paste instance id of what we trying to import)
